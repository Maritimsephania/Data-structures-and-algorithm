Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.
Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

Approach
we can easily find any duplicate in the array just by using two nested loops. The first loop will pick integers one by one from the array and the second nested loop will check if there exists any duplicate or not.
